### Description
A lightweight, minimalist solution for keeping track of your day-to-day tasks. Cut down on digital clutter using our sleek interface designed to show you exactly what you have left to do and what you've already checked off. When you're ready for a clean slate, just 'clear all'. Your todos are stored locally so you don't have to worry about keeping track between sessions or leaving that extra pesky tab open.
